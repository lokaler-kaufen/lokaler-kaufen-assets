# lokaler-kaufen-assets
This repository contains all design source files and renderings for usage in the lokaler.kaufen application, website and promotional material.

## Conventions
* Pixel graphics should have a _WIDTHxHEIGHT suffix, with both width and height being pixel values.
* Updates in one of the source files should always be reflected in the rendered pixel graphics and SVG files.
* We usually use the Affinity Suite to create our source files. If you don't have Affinity products, we also accept other vector formats, preferably SVG.
